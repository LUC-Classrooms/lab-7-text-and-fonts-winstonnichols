# Lab 7 - Working with Text and Fonts

The second half of chapter 7 in your textbook is devoted to putting text on the canvas and working with fonts. In this exercise, you will store a **string** of text in a _variable_ and display it on screen. In addition, you will add some **interactive** features that will change the text and its display according to user actions.

## Instructions:

_Modify the sketch in three ways_

1. **change** the text strings to your own two phrases
2. make the second phrase appear **only** when the mouse is pressed
3. change the **font** to something besides Arial (maybe a different font/size for each phrase?)

* 1 **extra credit** point for making the second phrase REPLACE the first phrase when the mouse is pressed

### When you are done ...
* As usual, commit your work GitHub as "Lab 7 submitted" (so I know you're done).
* Then, **download** your project as .zip and submit it on **Sakai** with a link to your repository.
